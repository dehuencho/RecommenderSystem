## Reading and preprocessing data

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(reticulate)
library(kableExtra)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

Importamos las librerias que vamos a utilizar
```{python}
#Dataframe manipulation library
import pandas as pd
#Math functions, we'll only need the sqrt function so let's import only that
from math import sqrt
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Cargamos los datos de pelicular y ratings: 
```{python}
#Storing the movie information into a pandas dataframe
movies_df = pd.read_csv('data/ml-latest/movies.csv')
#Storing the user information into a pandas dataframe
ratings_df = pd.read_csv('data/ml-latest/ratings.csv')
```

Procesamos la tabla *movies_df* para crear una columnas con el aÃ±o. 

```{python}
#Using regular expressions to find a year stored between parentheses
#We specify the parantheses so we don't conflict with movies that have years in their titles
movies_df['year'] = movies_df.title.str.extract('(\(\d\d\d\d\))',expand=False)
#Removing the parentheses
movies_df['year'] = movies_df.year.str.extract('(\d\d\d\d)',expand=False)
#Removing the years from the 'title' column
movies_df['title'] = movies_df.title.str.replace('(\(\d\d\d\d\))', '', regex=True)
#Applying the strip function to get rid of any ending whitespace characters that may have appeared
movies_df['title'] = movies_df['title'].apply(lambda x: x.strip())
```

Mostramos una muestra de la tabla *movies_df*.
```{r table1, echo=FALSE}
data.frame(py$movies_df)[1:7,] %>%
    kbl() %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),
                  full_width = F, position = "center")
```

Separamos la columna genero en una columna con listas. 
```{python}
#Every genre is separated by a | so we simply have to call the split function on |
movies_df['genres'] = movies_df.genres.str.split('|')
```

Creamos columnas dummy para cada genero en la columna con la lista de generos.
```{python}
#Copying the movie dataframe into a new one since we won't need to use the genre information in our first case.
moviesWithGenres_df = movies_df.copy()

#For every row in the dataframe, iterate through the list of genres and place a 1 into the corresponding column
for index, row in movies_df.iterrows():
    for genre in row['genres']:
        moviesWithGenres_df.at[index, genre] = 1
#Filling in the NaN values with 0 to show that a movie doesn't have that column's genre
moviesWithGenres_df = moviesWithGenres_df.fillna(0)
```

Eliminamos la columna timestamp de la tabla *rating_df*
```{python}
#Drop removes a specified row or column from a dataframe
ratings_df = ratings_df.drop('timestamp', 1)
```

## Content-Based recommendation system

Now, let's take a look at how to implement Content-Based or Item-Item recommendation systems. This technique attempts to figure out what a user's favourite aspects of an item is, and then recommends items that present those aspects. In our case, we're going to try to figure out the input's favorite genres from the movies and ratings given.

Let's begin by creating an input user to recommend movies to:

*Notice: To add more movies, simply increase the amount of elements in the userInput. Feel free to add more in! Just be sure to write it in with capital letters and if a movie starts with a "The", like "The Matrix" then write it in like this: 'Matrix, The'.*
```{python}
userInput = [
            {'title':'Breakfast Club, The', 'rating':5},
            {'title':'Toy Story', 'rating':3.5},
            {'title':'Jumanji', 'rating':2},
            {'title':"Pulp Fiction", 'rating':5},
            {'title':'Akira', 'rating':4.5}
         ] 
inputMovies = pd.DataFrame(userInput)
```

#### Add movieId to input user
With the input complete, let's extract the input movie's ID's from the movies dataframe and add them into it.

We can achieve this by first filtering out the rows that contain the input movie's title and then merging this subset with the input dataframe. We also drop unnecessary columns for the input to save memory space.

```{python}
#Filtering out the movies by title
inputId = movies_df[movies_df['title'].isin(inputMovies['title'].tolist())]
#Then merging it so we can get the movieId. It's implicitly merging it by title.
inputMovies = pd.merge(inputId, inputMovies)
#Dropping information we won't use from the input dataframe
inputMovies = inputMovies.drop('genres', 1).drop('year', 1)
#Final input dataframe
#If a movie you added in above isn't here, then it might not be in the original 
#dataframe or it might spelled differently, please check capitalisation.
```

We're going to start by learning the input's preferences, so let's get the subset of movies that the input has watched from the Dataframe containing genres defined with binary values.

```{python}
#Filtering out the movies from the input
userMovies = moviesWithGenres_df[moviesWithGenres_df['movieId'].isin(inputMovies['movieId'].tolist())]
```

We'll only need the actual genre table, so let's clean this up a bit by resetting the index and dropping the movieId, title, genres and year columns.

```{python}
#Resetting the index to avoid future issues
userMovies = userMovies.reset_index(drop=True)
#Dropping unnecessary issues due to save memory and to avoid issues
userGenreTable = userMovies.drop('movieId', 1).drop('title', 1).drop('genres', 1).drop('year', 1)
```

Now we're ready to start learning the input's preferences!

To do this, we're going to turn each genre into weights. We can do this by using the input's reviews and multiplying them into the input's genre table and then summing up the resulting table by column. This operation is actually a dot product between a matrix and a vector, so we can simply accomplish by calling Pandas's "dot" function.

```{python}
#Dot produt to get weights
userProfile = userGenreTable.transpose().dot(inputMovies['rating'])
#The user profile
#userProfile
```

Now, we have the weights for every of the user's preferences. This is known as the User Profile. Using this, we can recommend movies that satisfy the user's preferences.

Let's start by extracting the genre table from the original dataframe:

```{python}
#Now let's get the genres of every movie in our original dataframe
genreTable = moviesWithGenres_df.set_index(moviesWithGenres_df['movieId'])
#And drop the unnecessary information
genreTable = genreTable.drop('movieId', 1).drop('title', 1).drop('genres', 1).drop('year', 1)
#genreTable.head()
```

With the input's profile and the complete list of movies and their genres in hand, we're going to take the weighted average of every movie based on the input profile and recommend the top twenty movies that most satisfy it.

```{python}
#Multiply the genres by the weights and then take the weighted average
recommendationTable_df = ((genreTable*userProfile).sum(axis=1))/(userProfile.sum())
#recommendationTable_df.head()
```

```{python}
#Sort our recommendations in descending order
recommendationTable_df = recommendationTable_df.sort_values(ascending=False)
#Just a peek at the values
#recommendationTable_df.head()
```

Now here's the recommendation table!
```{python}
#The final recommendation table
recommend_df = movies_df.loc[movies_df['movieId'].isin(recommendationTable_df.head(20).keys())]
```

## Result: recommendation 1

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data.frame(py$recommend_df)[1:15,] %>%
    kbl() %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),
                  full_width = F, position = "center")
```

## Collaborative Filtering

Now, time to start our work on recommendation systems.

The first technique we're going to take a look at is called **Collaborative Filtering**, which is also known as **User-User Filtering**. As hinted by its alternate name, this technique uses other users to recommend items to the input user. It attempts to find users that have similar preferences and opinions as the input and then recommends items that they have liked to the input. There are several methods of finding similar users (Even some making use of Machine Learning), and the one we will be using here is going to be based on the **Pearson Correlation Function**.

</center>

The process for creating a User Based recommendation system is as follows:

* Select a user with the movies the user has watched
* Based on his rating to movies, find the top X neighbours
* Get the watched movie record of the user for each neighbour.
* Calculate a similarity score using some formula
* Recommend the items with the highest score
* Let's begin by creating an input user to recommend movies to:

*Notice: To add more movies, simply increase the amount of elements in the userInput. Feel free to add more in! Just be sure to write it in with capital letters and if a movie starts with a "The", like "The Matrix" then write it in like this: 'Matrix, The'.*

We use the same fictional user from before *inputMovies*. 

Now with the movie ID's in our input, we can now get the subset of users that have watched and reviewed the movies in our input.

```{python}
#Filtering out users that have watched movies that the input has watched and storing it
userSubset = ratings_df[ratings_df['movieId'].isin(inputMovies['movieId'].tolist())]
```

We now group up the rows by user ID.
```{python}
#Groupby creates several sub dataframes where they all have the same value in the column specified as the parameter
userSubsetGroup = userSubset.groupby(['userId'])
```

Lets look at one of the users, e.g. the one with userID=1130
```{python}
userSubsetGroup.get_group(1130)
```

Let's also sort these groups so the users that share the most movies in common with the input have higher priority. This provides a richer recommendation since we won't go through every single user.
```{python}
#Sorting it so users with movie most in common with the input will have priority
userSubsetGroup = sorted(userSubsetGroup,  key=lambda x: len(x[1]), reverse=True)
```

Now lets look at the first user
```{python}
userSubsetGroup[0:2]
```

**Similarity of users to input user**

Next, we are going to compare all users (not really all !!!) to our specified user and find the one that is most similar. 

We're going to find out how similar each user is to the input through the **Pearson Correlation Coefficient**. It is used to measure the strength of a linear association between two variables. The formula for finding this coefficient between sets X and Y with N values can be seen in the image below.

Why Pearson Correlation?

Pearson correlation is invariant to scaling, i.e. multiplying all elements by a nonzero constant or adding any constant to all elements. For example, if you have two vectors X and Y,then, pearson(X, Y) == pearson(X, 2 * Y + 3). This is a pretty important property in recommendation systems because for example two users might rate two series of items totally different in terms of absolute rates, but they would be similar users (i.e. with similar ideas) with similar rates in various scales.

![](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bd1ccc2979b0fd1c1aec96e386f686ae874f9ec0 "Pearson Correlation")

The values given by the formula vary from r = -1 to r = 1, where 1 forms a direct correlation between the two entities (it means a perfect positive correlation) and -1 forms a perfect negative correlation.

In our case, a 1 means that the two users have similar tastes while a -1 means the opposite.

We will select a subset of users to iterate through. This limit is imposed because we don't want to waste too much time going through every single user.

```{python}
## Subset
userSubsetGroup = userSubsetGroup[0:100]
```


Now, we calculate the Pearson Correlation between input user and subset group, and store it in a dictionary, where the key is the user Id and the value is the coefficient
```{python}
#Store the Pearson Correlation in a dictionary, where the key is the user Id and the value is the coefficient
pearsonCorrelationDict = {}

#For every user group in our subset
for name, group in userSubsetGroup:
    #Let's start by sorting the input and current user group so the values aren't mixed up later on
    group = group.sort_values(by='movieId')
    inputMovies = inputMovies.sort_values(by='movieId')
    #Get the N for the formula
    nRatings = len(group)
    #Get the review scores for the movies that they both have in common
    temp_df = inputMovies[inputMovies['movieId'].isin(group['movieId'].tolist())]
    #And then store them in a temporary buffer variable in a list format to facilitate future calculations
    tempRatingList = temp_df['rating'].tolist()
    #Let's also put the current user group reviews in a list format
    tempGroupList = group['rating'].tolist()
    #Now let's calculate the pearson correlation between two users, so called, x and y
    Sxx = sum([i**2 for i in tempRatingList]) - pow(sum(tempRatingList),2)/float(nRatings)
    Syy = sum([i**2 for i in tempGroupList]) - pow(sum(tempGroupList),2)/float(nRatings)
    Sxy = sum( i*j for i, j in zip(tempRatingList, tempGroupList)) - sum(tempRatingList)*sum(tempGroupList)/float(nRatings)
    
    #If the denominator is different than zero, then divide, else, 0 correlation.
    if Sxx != 0 and Syy != 0:
        pearsonCorrelationDict[name] = Sxy/sqrt(Sxx*Syy)
    else:
        pearsonCorrelationDict[name] = 0

```

```{python}
pearsonCorrelationDict.items() 
```

```{python}
pearsonDF = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(pearsonCorrelationDict, orient='index')
pearsonDF.columns = ['similarityIndex']
pearsonDF['userId'] = pearsonDF.index
pearsonDF.index = range(len(pearsonDF))
pearsonDF.head()
```

**The top x similar users to input user**

Now let's get the top 50 users that are most similar to the input.

```{python}
topUsers=pearsonDF.sort_values(by='similarityIndex', ascending=False)[0:50]
```

**Rating of selected users to all movies**

We're going to do this by taking the weighted average of the ratings of the movies using the Pearson Correlation as the weight. But to do this, we first need to get the movies watched by the users in our pearsonDF from the ratings dataframe and then store their correlation in a new column called _similarityIndex". This is achieved below by merging of these two tables.
```{python}
topUsersRating=topUsers.merge(ratings_df, left_on='userId', right_on='userId', how='inner')
```

Now all we need to do is simply multiply the movie rating by its weight (The similarity index), then sum up the new ratings and divide it by the sum of the weights.

We can easily do this by simply multiplying two columns, then grouping up the dataframe by movieId and then dividing two columns:

It shows the idea of all similar users to candidate movies for the input user:
```{python}
#Multiplies the similarity by the user's ratings
topUsersRating['weightedRating'] = topUsersRating['similarityIndex']*topUsersRating['rating']
```

```{python}
#Applies a sum to the topUsers after grouping it up by userId
tempTopUsersRating = topUsersRating.groupby('movieId').sum()[['similarityIndex','weightedRating']]
tempTopUsersRating.columns = ['sum_similarityIndex','sum_weightedRating']
```

```{python}
#Creates an empty dataframe
recommendation_df = pd.DataFrame()
#Now we take the weighted average
recommendation_df['weighted average recommendation score'] = tempTopUsersRating['sum_weightedRating']/tempTopUsersRating['sum_similarityIndex']
recommendation_df['movieId'] = tempTopUsersRating.index
```


Now let's sort it and see the top 20 movies that the algorithm recommended!

```{python}
recommendation_df = recommendation_df.sort_values(by='weighted average recommendation score', ascending=False)
```

```{python}
recommendation_df2 = movies_df.loc[movies_df['movieId'].isin(recommendation_df.head(10)['movieId'].tolist())]
```

## Result: recommendation 2
